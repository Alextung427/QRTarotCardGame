Before you begin, make sure to install the following dependencies from the terminal/ command prompt 
if you dont already have it installed.

You dont need the QRGenerator to play the game. We've included it in the repository so that if you are interested in making
your own QR code you can use it to make any card you like.

Copy and paste the following codes, line by line into you terminal/command prompt to install the dependencies required:
pip install pyzbar
pip install pyttsx3
pip install opencv-python
pip install PyQRCode (for QRGenerator)

You may also have to download pywin32 if you are on windows and are having issues with the speak buttons not working. 
I downloaded pywin32-228.win32-py3.8.exe from 
https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/releases 
but you should download the one that corresponds with your version of windows.

In the tarot cards folder, you will find 78 different cards to choose from.
Select 6 cards corresponding to the following categories:
1. How you feel about yourself now?
2. What you most want at this moment?
3. Your fears
4. What is going for you?
5. What is going against you?
6. The outcome according to your current situation or the question you asked.

You will need the 6 cards that you have chosen either on your phone or printed to show the card to your webcam.
When you open the program, click the scan button and your webcam will open.
Hold up one of the cards that you have chosen in front of your webcam and when you are confident that the webcam has seen it,
press your esc key to exit the scanner.
You may press the speak button next to the description of the card to listen to the text.
Do this for the next 5 cards.

Thank you for using our program.
